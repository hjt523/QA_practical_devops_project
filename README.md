## QA_practical_devops_project
Second QA practical project for the DEVOPS course.

# Art Doodle Idea Generator 

This project is designed to display understanding of the DEVops pipeline technologies / Techniques, the app used to demonstrate this is a drawing idea generator. 

My plan is to have service one Display the results idea / maybe take some kind of input to seed the choices for the idea generated?
Service 2 could generate aesthetic, so for one version picking themes like moody, or bright, or geometric etc, then for the second version it could perhaps specify colour? 
Then service 3 could generate an object or scene? So that when passed to service 4 we get a scene with an aesthetic, then perhaps some additional details based randomly upon
the previously generated ideas.
